# Semester-Final-Project
This is a project written in C that combines pointers, file io, and  linked lists to create a task manager like process.

This program was my final project for my Intro to Computing in Electrical Engineering class which is basically an intro to C programming course. 
We were given a prompt and some starter code. The structure was given but I had to add the functionality to the code

Here is a breakdown of what each of the files contain:

Most of the functions of the project can be found in proj2.c which is basically completely written by me.
proj1.c contains the random struct propogation and main menu.
We were also given an external library proj2017.lib to link so we couldn't look at the code.
proj1.h contains the struct we use throughout the project.
proj2.h just contains function declations.
Finally, mainproj contains the main and the switch case for the main menu.
